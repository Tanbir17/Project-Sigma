In the unix world, you need to set the PATH environment variable to
point to the places where programs and shell scripts are located.

Since we use the bash shell, the main place that you add additional locations
to your path is in the ~/.bash_profile which is run once when you log in.

For a standard arduino-ua install, where the arduino-ua directory is located
in your home directory, you need to have this in your .bash_profile
    export PATH="~/arduino-ua/bin:$PATH"

Make sure your terminal runs as a login shell so that the .bash_profile is
executed when you open a new terminal.

As a general safety measure, you should have safe aliases set up for your
shell environment to prevent you from accidently clobbering your work.  These
aliases have the '-i' option turned on to make the commands interactive.

If you are in OSX, then you want to put the .bash_aliases_osx file into your
home directory, and add the lines
    . ~/.bash_aliases_osx 
    . ~/.bashrc
to your .bash_profile.

NOTE: the files have a . (period) added to the beginning of their name, thus
making them "hidden", and only visible through the "ls -a" option.

If you are in ubuntu, then the same pattern applies, although .bashrc
actually loads your .bash_aliases file, so you can get away with just the
setting of PATH in your .bash_profile.  Doing both does not hurt
    . ~/.bash_aliases 
    . ~/.bashrc


Finally, if you have located arduino-ua in a different place, then you
need to set the ARDUINO_UA_ROOT environment variable.  Suppose that you
have put it in the 'frameworks' directory in your home.  Then you need
to do this instead:
    export ARDUINO_UA_ROOT="frameworks"
    export PATH="$ARDUINO_UA_ROOT/arduino-ua/bin:$PATH"

Examples of all of these are in the misc directory here.
