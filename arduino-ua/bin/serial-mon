# serial-mon [port]
#
# Generic serial monitor for arduino boards.  We allow two different
# boards to be connected (at present) so have two possible ports 0, 1
# for attaching the serial monitor.
# if no port is supplied, 0 is used.
#
# the port lock files are used by the arduino makefiles to ensure that
# - an upload is not attempted when minicom has the port.
# - only one serial monitor is running.
# other programs that communicate on the port should probbaly use the
# same kind of lockfile mechanism since it is not a good idea to attempt
# an upload when the port is in use by another program.

# which port are we using?
