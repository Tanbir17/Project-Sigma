Python Data Structure Visualizer

This class is used to extract the structure graph of a Python data
structure and then generate a graphviz .dot file that can be used to
display the digraph structure.

For downloads of graphviz and the documentation etc, see
    http://www.graphviz.org/

Nodes in the digraph are objects. Each node is tagged with the type of
the associated object. An edge A -> B in the digraph, from object A to
object B indicates that the object A references the object B. That is,
some attribute (a name if you like) of object A is bound to object B.

Two kinds of structure descriptions are provided.

The detailed-object description preserves Python's everything is an
object principle. This means that there will be many links to the same
object, like the number 42.

The compact description folds atomic like objects into the label on the
node. So for example, rather than there being a link to 42 from the 4th
element of a list, the 4th element shows 42. If the element is not
atomic, then there will be a * in that posiiton and a link to the object
being referenced.

Once a structure is analyzed, you can build either or both styles of
description.  If the structure changes you need to re-analyze it in
order to capture any structural changes.  Changes in the value of atomic
objects will be reflected if you re-generate the description.

This is a typical use case if you are repeatedly dumping the .dot file
for graphviz to render as you step through an algorithm:

    from StructViz import *
    def update_dot(v, obj, basename, style='compact'):
        f = open(basename + '.dot', "w", encoding="utf-8")
        v.analyze_struct(obj)
        if style == 'compact':
            rep = v.gen_compact_dot_desc()
        else:
            rep = v.gen_detailed_dot_desc()
        f.write(rep)
        f.close()

Minimal doc tests

    >>> v = StructViz()

    >>> obj = [1, '42', [2, 3] ]

    >>> v.analyze_struct(v)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
    ValueError: Cannot analyze yourself!

    >>> v.analyze_struct(obj)

    >>> full_object_desc = v.gen_detailed_dot_desc()

    >>> compact_desc = v.gen_compact_dot_desc()

    The data structure is represented as a dict of nodes, keyed by
    object id. Each node is itself a dict with these fields:

    name - is the string name of the node to be used in creating
    the .dot file

    type - is the python type object that the node represents

    style - the style of node for display purposes
        'A' - singleton/atomic object, contents = None
        'L' - list-like object,
                contents = [ obj_id1, obj_id1, obj_id1, ... ]
              referencing the objects in position order
        'D' - dictionary like

        'G' - some object with a __dict__ attribute,
        'I' - internal undisplayable object
        'U' - some unknown kind of object

    seqnum - the sequence number of the node as it is generated.
        used to improve the quality of the graphviz layout

    referers - is a list of all the other nodes that reference this
    one. Each referer is a (obj_id, pos) tuple where obj_id is the id
    of the object referencing this node, and pos is the position of
    the reference in the referring object collection. The position is 0 for
    non-collections, and an non-negative integer for collections.
    Hmm, a non collection cannot refer to an object?

    obj - ref to the actual object that this node is associated with

    contents - if non empty, it is a list of the object id's that
    are contained in this object, as a collection. The list of ids
    induces a position for the reference so that edges can be drawn
    from specific parts of the referencing collection to the
    referenced object.
