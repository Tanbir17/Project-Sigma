Version 2.2.1 2012-11-06

Fixed the generation of asm source files during compilation.  No longer
generated by default.   To generate set the make GENERATE_ASM=1 variable
either in your Makefile or on the command 
    make GENERATE_ASM=1

Also added a check that the .hex file that is being uploaded to the 
board does not contain the !!! (3 exclamation marks) problem that causes
the old stk500boot_v2_mega2560 to hang.  You will get a warning that id the
upload will hang if the old bootloader is on your Mega board.

    check-hex-file code.hex

will see if there is a !!! sequence lurking in the data to be uploaded.

The new bootloader has been placed into the tool chain, so if you have a
board programmer you can install it on your arduino.

The arduino extension libraries (not the code) are now in one common location 
that is linked to by each of the os variants.  This means that only one set of
libraries needs to be updated when bugs are fixed.
    arduino-ua/arduino-libraries/

Version 2.2.0 2012-10-24

Major overhaul of the arduino-ua/bin and arduino-ua/mkfiles to handle mapping
of serial ports to arduinos for uploads.  You should execute the script
    arduino-port-select
whenever you change the configuration of which board is plugged where.  It
establishes some ~/.arduino_* configuration files in your home directory that
are used to coordinate the serial monitor and avrdude for uploads so that you
don't attempt to do an upload to a port when there is a serial mon running
on that port.

Explicit port definitions have been removed from makefiles.

You can run serial monitors on specific configured ports with
    serial-mon 0
    serial-mon 1

Also added UAUtils library to contain misc libraries that are used in the 
UA environment.

Make sure to put the files in distrib/ubuntu-rcfiles.zip into your home
directory to ensure that you have the safe rm,mv,cp,ln aliases in place and
that your arduino and home bin are in the $PATH so that the arduino-ua/bin
directory can be located.

The environment variable ARDUINO_UA_ROOT that if set will point to
the directory that contains your arduino-ua directory.  If not present,
it defaults to $HOME.  If you have put arduino-ua into differnent place,
say "ard" in your home directory, then you should have
    export ARDUINO_UA_ROOT=$HOME/ard
in your .bash_profile, and also make sure that the arduino-ua/bin is properly
added to your $PATH as in
    export PATH=$ARDUINO_UA_ROOT/arduino-ua/bin:$PATH

NOTE: detailed instructions on setting up your path are in the file
    bin/how-to-setup-path.txt

Finally, the arduino start script and the makefiles will then determine what
kind of ubuntu install is in place and chooses the 32 or 64 bit linux versions
as requird.

Version 2.1.2 2012-10-17

This is the OSX and 32-bit Ubuntu 12.04 version of the U Alberta environment 
for the Arduino.  At the moment it assumes that everything is under 
~/arduino-ua, but we will change that to allow re-rooting the file tree
at the environment variable ARDUINO_UA_ROOT in the next release.

- make sure you untar it into your home directory with
    tar xvzf the-distribution-name.tgz
the result should be two directories
    arduino-ua
and
    toolchain

- you need to add arduino-ua/bin to your path so that the upload and serial-mon
scripts will work.  To do this, you need to have a 
    ~/.bash_profile
and make sure that you have this line in it at some point:
    export PATH=~/arduino-ua/bin:$PATH

The components are:

- Arduino 1.0.1 modified to use avr libc 1.7.1

- U Alberta libraries for use in the Tangible Computing course, including
makefiles for the direct use of the avr toolchain instead of the IDE.

- an installation of minicom 2.6.1 for use as the serial monitor.  It is 
prebuilt for OSX 10.7, but if you have an earlier OSX release you might need
to recompile.
    cd distrib
    tar xvzf minicom-2.6.1.tgz
    cd minicom-2.6.1
    ./configure
    make
and then copy src/minicom into the arduio-ua/bin directory

and ports
